# Star-Map-Generator
P06 - Star Map Generator for Senior Capstone

## Requirements from Prof
- [ ] The user shall be able to enter the latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes for 
the observer location, a date between January 1, 1900 and January 1, 2100, and a 
clock time in local hours and minutes.

- [ ] The software system will generate and save star map images to disk in the Joint 
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format. Resolution shall be a minimum of 300 
dpi and the image should fit on a standard 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper when printed.

- [ ] Images shall be displayed on screen in a scrollable window.

- [ ] The star map images shall include the approximately 20,000 stars in the Yale Star 
Catalog. Stars must be drawn so as to indicate visually the magnitude of the star.  
Only stars of 6th magnitude and less need to be included. Named stars shall have a 
label next to them.  For the on-screen display the user shall be able to show or hide 
the labels.

- [ ] All major constellations shall be labeled and lines shall be drawn to connect the stars 
of constellations in the form familiar to all amateur astronomers. For the on-screen 
display the user shall be able to show or hide the labels.

- [ ] The star map images shall include the locations of all major planets (Mercury, Venus, 
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) visible at the given date and time.  
Labels and icons on the map shall identify each. For the on-screen display the user 
shall be able to show or hide the labels.

- [ ] The star map images shall include the location and phase of the moon, if visible, at 
the given date and time.

- [ ] The star map shall include the location with appropriate labels of all the Messier deep 
space objects.  For the on-screen display the user shall be able to show or hide the 
labels.

- [ ] The software shall be upgradeable so that additional objects such as comets, minor 
planets (Pluto, Ceres, Juno, etc.), and other deep sky objects can be added without 
extensive modifications to the software. (hint: study Design Patterns: Elements of 
Reusable Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides)
